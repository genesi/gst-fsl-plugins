One errata was published for MX53 TO2.0 VPU:
 ENGcm11856 IPU and VPU may present some artifacts when running at 200Mhz

Description:
 Due to a memory timing problem on memories used in the i.MX53 IPU and VPU,
 these blocks
 may miscalculate incoming data for decoding. The problem occurs when
 the IPU and VPU are
 running at max frequency of 200Mhz..

Projected Impact:
 Some artifacts may be seen on the decoded image.

Workarounds:
 None

Proposed Solution:
 Planned to be fixed in i.MX53 revision 2.1.

Since your TO2.0 boards are not screened before, you may meet above
issues when using the boards.

You can try the following method to identify whether itâ€™s the same issue:

1. Increase VCC voltage as 1.35V. The following u-boot commands can achieve it:
i2c mw 0x48 0x2f 0x62
i2c mw 0x48 0x3c 0x62


2. Or reduce peripher clock just like the below in U-Boot:
clk periph 330
